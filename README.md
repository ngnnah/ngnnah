- 👋 Hi, I’m Nhat Nguyen @github.com/ngnnah
- 🎓 I've just graduated from MIT (Jun 2021), with a major in Computer Science and Engineering. 
- 👀 I’m interested in design and implementation of software applications and business solutions, and clean and performant Python code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about databases, SQL, Django, Selenium, and more Python and JavaScript and automation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source and non-profit projects. 
- 👨‍💻 I'm looking for SWE roles in Travel Planning, Fintech, Logistic and Arbitrage, and Climate Change solutions (preferably projects involved consumer-facing products using Python)
- 📫 I can be reached at: [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nhatn1507/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nhat-nguyen-51b1a5214/), [email](ngnnah@gmail.com)
- 🏍️ 🚴 📷  I enjoy riding bicycle and motorcyle, and taking photos while traveling.
